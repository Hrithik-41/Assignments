ASSIGNMENT 1:
Module 2: Basic Python Concepts
 
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

*****Solution: 
1. Created 2 variables to take input from user and store.
2. Created more variables as per operations named and stored the values by using operaters.
3. Created 4 print statement to print the variable as per operations

Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

*****Solution:
1. Created 2 variables asking first and last name as an input from user.
2. Created a variable as a full_name to concatenate first and last name
3. Printed the statement with greeting.



ASSIGNMENT 2:
Module 3: Control Structures in Python

Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

*****Solution: 
1. Created num variable to take input from user and store.
2. With if else statement, first check the input is even or not by giving getting remainder 0 using modulus operator.
3. If remainder is 0 printed Even else printed Odd.
Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

*****Solution:
1. Created num variable and stored the value to add and sum variable initiated with 0.
2. Initiated for loop and given a range to num+1.
3. Inside for loop given a statement to add and store the value in sum.
4. Printed as the final output stored.



ASSIGNMENT 3:
Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 

*****Solution:
1. Created num variable to take input from user and store.
2. created function factorial and passed num variable as an argument.
3. Inside the function started if else statement, if num is lesser than 2 it returns 1.
4. Else using factorial formula returns the factorial of num.
5. Outside the function created print statement, inside the statement called the function by passing num.

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

*****Solution:
1. imported math module.
2. Created num variable to take input from user and store as a float.
3. Using multiple math function's printed the log, sine and square root of the number.
